Use only the facts from the CONTEXT when answering the question.\\nIf the CONTEXT doesn't contain the answer, output NONE\\n\\nQUESTION: the course has already started, can I still enroll?\\n\\nCONTEXT:\\nsection: Workshop 1 - dlthub\\nquestion: How do I install the necessary dependencies to run the code?\\nanswer: Answer: To run the provided code, ensure that the 'dlt[duckdb]' package is installed. You can do this by executing the provided installation command: !pip install dlt[duckdb]. If you’re doing it locally, be sure to also have duckdb pip installed (even before the duckdb package is loaded).\\n\\nsection: General course-related questions\\nquestion: How do I use Git / GitHub for this course?\\nanswer: After you create a GitHub account, you should clone the course repo to your local machine using the process outlined in this video: Git for Everybody: How to Clone a Repository from GitHub\\nHaving this local repository on your computer will make it easy for you to access the instructors’ code and make pull requests (if you want to add your own notes or make changes to the course content).\\nYou will probably also create your own repositories that host your notes, versions of your file, to do this. Here is a great tutorial that shows you how to do this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/setting-up-a-repository\\nRemember to ignore large database, .csv, and .gz files, and other files that should not be saved to a repository. Use .gitignore for this: https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/gitignore NEVER store passwords or keys in a git repo (even if that repo is set to private).\\nThis is also a great resource: https://dangitgit.com/\\n\\nsection: Module 4: analytics engineering with dbt\\nquestion: BigQuery returns an error when i try to run ‘dbt run’:\\nanswer: My taxi data was loaded into gcs with etl_web_to_gcs.py script that converts csv data into parquet. Then I placed raw data trips into external tables and when I executed dbt run I got an error message: Parquet column 'passenger_count' has type INT64 which does not match the target cpp_type DOUBLE. It is because several columns in files have different formats of data.\\nWhen I added df[col] = df[col].astype('Int64') transformation to the columns: passenger_count, payment_type, RatecodeID, VendorID, trip_type it went ok. Several people also faced this error and more about it you can read on the slack channel.\\n\\nsection: Project\\nquestion: How to run python as start up script?\\nanswer: You need to redefine the python environment variable to that of your user account\\n\\nsection: Module 5: pyspark\\nquestion: How to spark standalone cluster is run on windows OS\\nanswer: Change the working directory to the spark directory:\\nif you have setup up your SPARK_HOME variable, use the following;\\ncd %SPARK_HOME%\\nif not, use the following;\\ncd <path to spark installation>\\nCreating a Local Spark Cluster\\nTo start Spark Master:\\nbin\\\\spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.master.Master --host localhost\\nStarting up a cluster:\\nbin\\\\spark-class org.apache.spark.deploy.worker.Worker spark://localhost:7077 --host localhost\""
